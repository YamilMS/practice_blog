# practice_blog
Blog done in plain html, css and vanilla js

The idea of this project is to replicate this design:

Here is a snapshot of the goal design:

Also implement npm, using modules with webpack. This was done using dayjs in order to display a real time local clock on the blog

In the other hand, vanilla js was used to create pagination and some interactive design features.

In the github tab, vanila js was used to access the Github API to get information of the users.
